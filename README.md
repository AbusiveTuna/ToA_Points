Plugin that tracks your ToA points based on Jagex's recent blog post: https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/tombs-of-amascut-drop-mechanics--osmumtens-fang?oldschool=1

**Current Issues:**

Doesn't properly track MVP points (outside of solos)
MVP assumption config option will give you 2700 points total throughout
the raid, which is the total MVP points for solos. 

Estimates your points on warden p2 and Zebak Watering Palm
This is due to them having different hitsplats that the player doesn't own.
Basically you'll always get an equal amount of points on these two
as the rest of your team. 

Doesn't give points for Scabaras puzzles (100 each)

Doesn't give points for Monkey room vents/pillars (70? each)

These both add for around ~500 per raid, which will be hard to notice but
still found it worth mentioning here.

**Future Updates:**

Add better MVP tracker

Add Party plugin

Add Scabaras/Monkey points
