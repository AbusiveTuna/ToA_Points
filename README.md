Plugin that tracks your ToA points based on Jagex's recent blog post: https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/tombs-of-amascut-drop-mechanics--osmumtens-fang?oldschool=1

**Current Issues:**

Doesn't properly track MVP points (outside of solos)
MVP assumption config option will give you 2700 points total throughout
the raid, which is the total MVP points for solos. 

Estimates your points on warden p2 and Zebak Watering Palm
This is due to them having different hitsplats that the player doesn't own.
Basically you'll always get an equal amount of points on these two
as the rest of your team. 

**Future Updates:**

Add better MVP tracker

Add Party plugin
